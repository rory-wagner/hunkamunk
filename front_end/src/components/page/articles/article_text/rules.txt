Rules to the json in this directory:

    the simple format goes as follows:

    export default {
        title_text: "",
        title_picture: "",
        article_parts: [
            "Some text",
            "path to img",
        ]
    };

The hard part to distinguish here is that every even part in article_parts is text, while the odd indeces are pictures.
